# Microsoft Azure Training for developers and architects - advanced


## Description

This workshop is designed for professional enterprise developers and architects, who target migration of existing traditional “on-prem” applications to cloud or design and implementation of modern cloud applications. Attendees will start with application virtualization with container technologies and learn how to design, build and operate applications in containers inside of Azure or any other cloud or on-prem environment. As next, attendees learn about core storage services inside of Azure, which are mostly used inside of any kind of application. Then, focus is set on building of modern applications with PaaS and Serverless services, which help build extremely innovative solutions in very short time.
One of major parts of this workshop focus messaging and integration patterns, which are essential for building of a scalable, cloud well approved microservice and service-oriented architecture. In the last art of workshop attendees will learn about various database technologies, which are increasingly becoming essential part of almost every modern application. 
It is designed and delivered by Microsoft internationally recognized professionals, who helped many customers to move to the Azure in the last decade.

## Goals
The goal of this workshop to help professional enterprise developers and architects to move to Azure Cloud. Based on long-year experience and best practices, attendees will learn about technology and strategy, which help to approach the Cloud mega trend in various ways.
You will first learn about platform evolution, lift-and shift scenarios, which help you to move existing applications to cloud. Then you will learn how to design modern applications for Azure and other clouds. This workshop is a unique opportunity to learn most important basics and advanced approaches, which every professional enterprise developer and architect needs to know.
